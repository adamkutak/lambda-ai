Create APIs easily!

Setup guide:
1. Install Python 3
2. Optional: Create a python venv and activate it
3. In your terminal, install dependencies by running "pip install -r requirements.txt"  
4. Run example tests in "test_api.py" or "test_db.py". I recommend picking which test to run one at a time.
